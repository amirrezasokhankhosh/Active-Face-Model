# Active-Face-Model
Using a set of face-images with diverse gestures of one person, this code builds a face model, and transfer any facial expression of any other person to a created one by the model. In another words, it can make a picture of the person who the model is based on doing the facial expression of any given image. The created picture is only the position of landmarks.
